# Image-Caption-Generation
Welcome to my Github repository for my Bachelor's thesis project, "Image Caption Generation"! This project was developed using a combination of powerful machine learning frameworks such as Keras and TensorFlow, with a focus on implementing the VGG16 pretrained model and LSTM framework.

The goal of this project was to develop an image captioning system that is capable of generating natural and meaningful descriptions of images. The system is trained on a large dataset of images and corresponding captions, using the VGG16 model to extract relevant features from the images, and LSTM framework to generate descriptive sentences.

This project is a great showcase of the power of machine learning and deep learning in the field of computer vision. With this system, you can generate accurate and meaningful captions for a wide variety of images, from scenic landscapes to everyday objects.

This is how exactly our model works:
